# Commands and Other Features

For commands to load you must have [VampireCommandFramework](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework) installed on the server as well.

**Notes**:
- Commands with `[horse=]` are optionally for specifying a horse by name and will default to the closest horse if not specified.
- üîí Requires admin permissions
- <ins>_Underlined_</ins> keys come from the config file.
- Horses should be tamed and not riden by a player for most commands

### This info is also **available in game** with `.help LeadAHorseToWater`

#### `.horse breed`

This process takes two horses and consumes <ins>_BreedingRequiredItem_</ins> * <ins>_BreedingCostAmount_</ins> from the player's inventory. The resulting horse will be a random mix of the two parents' stats as a 50/50 chance of inheriting each trait from either parent. Then randomly +/- <ins>_MutationRange_</ins> is applied based on the max stat for each attribute. Finally values are capped at <ins>_MaxSpeed_</ins>, <ins>_MaxAcceleration_</ins>, <ins>_MaxRotation_</ins>. The resulting horse will be named after the first parent.

#### `.horse tag-stats [horse=]`

This player command will add the current stats of the horse to it's name as a suffix. This is great to see the stats of a horse without having to open the inventory. This command may limited by name length as the game allows one extra character via their UI.

#### üîí `.horse rename [horse=] (newName)`

Powerful admin rename, this allows you do escape normal naming restrictions and use markup. This is useful for special rewards like making a horse's name color, bold, or even use some emojis or unicode.
**PSA**: This command can result in the drinking prefix breaking or tag-stats not fitting on the horse. Please don't report naming issues resulting from this command.

#### üîí `.horse whistle [horse=]` / `.horse warp [horse=]`

Whistle trys to brings the horse to you, warp teleports you to the horse.

#### üîí `.horse speed [horse=] (speed)`
#### üîí `.horse acceleration [horse=] (acceleration)` 
#### üîí `.horse rotation [horse=] (rotation)`

Set the horse's stats. These values are **not** capped by <ins>_MaxSpeed_</ins>, <ins>_MaxAcceleration_</ins>, or <ins>_MaxRotation_</ins>. Note that the game represents rotation as 10x the value displayed in the UI but the commands handle this for you and you should refer to the values as you see them in the UI.

#### üîí `.horse kill [horse=]`

Removes the horse immediately without any loot or corpse.

#### üîí `.horse cull [radius=5] [percentage=1]`

**WARNING**: This command will remove horses within the radius of the player. It choose `percentage` of the horses within the `radius`. This command is very useful for cleaning up a large number of horses. It is recommended to use a small radius to start. The default radius of 5 is about 1 tile. The default percentage 1 means 100% of the horses within the radius will be removed.

#### üîí `.horse spawn [count=1]`

Spawns either one or `count` horses around you.
